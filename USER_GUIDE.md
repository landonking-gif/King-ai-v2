## 🖥️ Dashboard Operations

*   **Command**: "Research dropshipping trends for 2025."
*   **Analyze**: "Why is PetPal losing money?"

**Status Indicators:**
*   🟢 **Online**: Brain is fast and responsive.

### To Stop the Server (Stop paying AWS)
1.  Log into your **AWS Console**.
2.  Select the instance (`i-xxxx`).
3.  Click **Instance State** -> **Stop**.
